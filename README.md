# quick_comment

This is a very simple app that I've made to play with the new `#[MapQueryParameter]` and `#[MapRequestPayload]` attributes in Symfony. I took the idea from this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1am1hjm/excited_to_launch_quickcomment/).

I've also made a simple frontend for this to play with [Symfony Live Components](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-live-component/current/index.html). It's in [`feature/ui`](https://github.com/iruoy/quick_comment/tree/feature/ui).
